Hi! I’m Cooper Hawtin, a 20 year old Australian IT enthusiast who is on the verge of completing their Associate’s degree in Information Technology. I started studying at RMIT mid-year back in 2017 about 6 months after finishing my Year 12 VCE studies. I can speak fluent English and Italian. Incoming fun fact: I make music! I don’t publish a lot of it, but I enjoy making my own electronic music and homegrown instrumental remakes of popular songs.

### Interest in IT

Now you’re probably wondering where my IT interests lie. Well, to start with I gained an interest in IT when I decided to build my first gaming PC. My friends had convinced me to move from console to PC after school had finished so I started to educate myself to know what I was getting into. After countless hours of YouTube crusades, I worked up the courage to build my first PC.

During that process however, I became intimately fascinated with how computers work. The more I learned the more I wanted to know. So for the next 6 months after Year 12 while I worked full time I did nothing but watch videos about how computers work, how their parts work, how programming works and kept getting sucked in. Eventually I got to the stage where I wanted to officially study IT at University, so I made my way to RMIT. I chose RMIT because their courses best fit what I was wanting to study and worked within my ATAR range. So far I have been getting exactly what I expected to learn while studying here. Networking, programming, website building, computer science, everything!

### Ideal Job

<img src="images\job.png"> 

This position is a catch-all position for an IT Administrator. This involves things from virtualization, to technical assistance, infrastructure design and more. This is the kind of position I aim for in the long term. IT Administration is particularly attractive to me because I love helping and teaching people but having a sense of responsibility for my own work at the same time. Not only that, but I don’t like limiting myself. If I’m going to do something professionally, I better know how to do most if not all the work.
The Skills required for a position like this would be those of someone who has worked in a similar role prior to this. One would need to know how to handle virtualization, infrastructure design, and technical support on a company scale.
While I may posses a lot of the skills required to hold such a role I do not have nearly enough practical experience in my field let alone the knowledge to scale said skills to a company level.
Nearing the end of my degree, the only way I can acquire said skills is to work my way to the top. Start with smaller IT jobs to gain real world experience and slowly climb my way up. The best way I can see to getting a lot of real world experience without spending years waiting for a promotion at any one job would be working for a temp agency and being sent around to many different companies and doing contract work for them (which is my current plan).

### Personal Profile

Myers-Briggs: INFJ-T
Learning style: Visual Learner. Visual: 55% / Auditory: 25% / Tactile: 20%
Creativity test: 67.97

What do these results mean for me? It means:
-	I’m someone who likes helping others but may not end up helping myself.
-	I’m a visual learner who likes to see what I’m trying to learn.
-	According to the creativity test, I’m someone who can handle a large quantity of information and be able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information.
I believe these results tell me that when working in a team I am most likely to be given some complex tasks while the leadership is left to someone else, and that should someone need help I will happily help them through what they need. When forming a team I should take note of the kind of people I am forming with and the potential clashes of personalities that may not gel well with my own.

### Project Idea

My project idea is a Raspberry Pi with a screen that is attached to the outside of meeting rooms. This would be loaded up with a program that would pull what current and upcoming meetings are to be held within the meeting room it is located at and display it to whomever wishes to read it.
This project was mentioned to me in passing by one of the IT staff at my current workplace. I have been thinking about it since wondering how I can achieve something like this. This would help with the current confusion at my workplace both by staff and external clients as to what room they are currently meeting in without needing to consult the receptionist straight away. Simply look at the room and it will display current and upcoming meetings.
The project I would like to build would be built from a Raspberry Pi 4. The software loaded onto the Pi would serve a small set of features to the users. Utilizing Outlook data, it would display today’s current, upcoming and past meetings to those who wish to view more information on a given meeting room. Ideally, the screen would show in a large font the name of the meeting currently taking place in the center with past meetings and future meetings in a smaller font on the top and bottom of the central text respectively. Users would be able to scroll up and down with their fingers through a vertical carousel menu to view more details of any given meeting on that day. When a meeting is selected the participants will be listed on the right hand side in list form. There would be a button on the bottom right of the screen that reads “Report a problem” with a list of premade issues such as “Incorrect attendance / Incorrect room / Meeting missing / Other”. Upon clicking said button, it will send an email to the reception desk detailing what room it was sent from and what error needs to be corrected. Upon emailing reception the user will be presented with a screen of where reception is located so as to resolve the issue. While the user is making their way to reception, the receptionist has a moment to correct the discrepancies detailed in the email and push the new data back to the raspberry pi. The receptionist will then tell the user the error is corrected and where they are to go, and the raspberry pi will display the new updated meeting information. The only software needed on the staff side would be Microsoft outlook, as this is where the raspberry pi will be pulling all its information from. Simply correct or create a new meeting and the Pi will update the information automatically with no input needed.
The hardware needed for this project would only need be the Raspberry Pi 4, a case for it and an accompanying touch screen panel for interaction. The software needed will need to be an in-house designed program written to pull events and listings from Microsoft outlook, will comply with our IT security standards and is able to run on the raspberry pi itself.
The skills required for a project like this will be mostly comprised of programming. Raspberry Pi’s are relatively easy enough to set up so a lot of the hard work will be done with programming the custom software for it. This will require someone intimately familiar with a programming language of their choice and who can write a program that runs 24/7 with little to no maintenance. Given this is the part that will require the most expertise, it should not be too difficult to get our own IT team to build this software. If they don’t have the time, then finding a contractor who could write it should also fair relatively easy.
Should this project be successful this would make the flow of meeting organization on all parties’ parts much easier. External clients will be able to quickly glance at a meeting room to confirm they are at the correct location, reception will not need to deal with assisting our guests unless they report a problem with our scheduling, and staff can benefit from the same advantages as our external clients in finding the correct meeting rooms without needing to go back and forth.
