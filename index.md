Hi! I’m Cooper Hawtin, a 20 year old Australian IT enthusiast who is on the verge of completing their Associate’s degree in Information Technology. I started studying at RMIT mid-year back in 2017 about 6 months after finishing my Year 12 VCE studies. I can speak fluent English and Italian. Incoming fun fact: I make music! I don’t publish a lot of it, but I enjoy making my own electronic music and homegrown instrumental remakes of popular songs.

### Interest in IT

Now you’re probably wondering where my IT interests lie. Well, to start with I gained an interest in IT when I decided to build my first gaming PC. My friends had convinced me to move from console to PC after school had finished so I started to educate myself to know what I was getting into. After countless hours of YouTube crusades, I worked up the courage to build my first PC.

During that process however, I became intimately fascinated with how computers work. The more I learned the more I wanted to know. So for the next 6 months after Year 12 while I worked full time I did nothing but watch videos about how computers work, how their parts work, how programming works and kept getting sucked in. Eventually I got to the stage where I wanted to officially study IT at University, so I made my way to RMIT. I chose RMIT because their courses best fit what I was wanting to study and worked within my ATAR range. So far I have been getting exactly what I expected to learn while studying here. Networking, programming, website building, computer science, everything!
