Hi! I’m Cooper Hawtin, a 20 year old Australian IT enthusiast who is on the verge of completing their Associate’s degree in Information Technology. I started studying at RMIT mid-year back in 2017 about 6 months after finishing my Year 12 VCE studies. I can speak fluent English and Italian. Incoming fun fact: I make music! I don’t publish a lot of it, but I enjoy making my own electronic music and homegrown instrumental remakes of popular songs.
